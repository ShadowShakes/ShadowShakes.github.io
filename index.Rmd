### Introduction

Hi, my name is Shaohan(Michael) Chen.

Now an enrolled Master of Science student in Biostatistics at Columbia University.

Love to study data science, play badminton, basketball and all kinds of games, and I love watching movies.

A big fan of Derrick Rose(an NBA basketball player) and RNG(a team in League of Legends).

Also an incoming health data scientist intern at CVS Health on 2023 summer.

Will devote myself to the data science application industry/research in the future.
